```

### 2. **Student Groups Management**
- ✅ Professors can create groups
- ✅ Add students to groups by email
- ✅ View group members
- ✅ Edit/delete groups
- ✅ Group-based quiz assignment

**Seed Groups:**
- **Algebra - Clasa 9A** (3 students: Andrei, Julia, George)
- **Geometrie - Clasa 11** (2 students: Catalin, George)

### 3. **Quiz System with Multiple Question Types**

#### Question Types:
1. **Single Choice (Grila - 1 Răspuns)**
   - Student selects ONE correct answer
   - Auto-scored

2. **Multiple Choice (Grila - Multiple)**
   - Student selects MULTIPLE correct answers
   - Must match ALL correct answers
   - Auto-scored

3. **Free Text (Răspuns Liber)**
   - Student writes free text
   - Scored by keyword matching or AI
   - Manual evaluation by professors

#### Features:
- ✅ Quiz creation by professors
- ✅ Question ordering
- ✅ Time limits per quiz
- ✅ Group-based assignment
- ✅ Student-only resolution
- ✅ Professor management (edit, delete, copy)

**Seed Quizzes:**
1. **Test Algebra - Operatii cu Numere** (30 min)
   - Q1: Single choice (25p)
   - Q2: Multiple choice (25p)
   - Q3: Free text (50p)
   - Assigned to: Algebra group

2. **Test Geometrie - Teorema Pitagora** (45 min)
   - Q1: Single choice (30p)
   - Q2: Multiple choice (30p)
   - Q3: Free text (40p)
   - Assigned to: Geometry group

### 4. **Timer Management & Persistence**

#### Start Quiz:
```
POST /api/v1/quizzes/start/{quiz_id}
```
- Creates attempt with `time_remaining` set to full duration
- Returns attempt ID for tracking
- Student can close browser safely

#### Timer Sync:
```
PUT /api/v1/quizzes/{attempt_id}/timer-sync
```
- Syncs with server time every 30 seconds (frontend)
- Prevents client-side cheating
- Accounts for time spent away

#### Auto-Submit:
```
POST /api/v1/quizzes/{attempt_id}/auto-submit
```
- Triggers when time expires
- Scores answered questions
- Marks attempt as completed

#### How It Works:
1. Student clicks "Start Test" → `/start` endpoint called
2. Frontend starts countdown timer locally
3. Every 30 seconds → `/timer-sync` called to verify with server
4. localStorage saves timer state
5. If tab closed/refreshed → timer restored from localStorage
6. When time expires → `/auto-submit` called automatically
7. Student can resume with remaining time

### 5. **Access Control**

#### Quiz Visibility:
- **Professors**: See only their own quizzes
- **Students**: See quizzes where they're in the assigned group OR public quizzes (no group)
- **Public Quizzes**: Quizzes with `group_id = NULL` visible to all students

#### Quiz Resolution:
- **Only Students**: Can submit quiz attempts
- **Only Allocated Students**: Can take group-assigned quizzes
- **Professor Protection**: Cannot submit quizzes (only manage them)

#### Group Management:
- **Professors**: Can create/edit/delete groups
- **Only Own Groups**: Professors manage only their groups

### 6. **Scoring System**

#### Single/Multiple Choice:
- Automatic scoring
- Full points if answer matches exactly
- Zero points if incorrect

#### Free Text:
- Manual review by professor (future: AI evaluation)
- Keyword matching for partial credit
- Professor can override score

#### Partial Credit:
```
- Exact keyword match: 50% points (partial credit)
- All keywords match: 100% points (full credit)
- No match: 0% points
```

2. If not logged in → Redirected to /login
3. Login with credentials → JWT token saved in localStorage
4. Token persists across page refreshes
5. On page refresh → Session automatically restored
6. User can now access protected routes

FOR STUDENTS:
7. Navigate to "Chestionare" → See available quizzes
8. Click quiz → Redirected to /quizzes/{id}/take
9. Click "Start Test" → Attempt created with timer
10. Answer questions → Auto-saved during quiz

## ⚠️ Known Issues & TODOs

### Pending:
1. ❌ AI Evaluation for free text answers
2. ❌ Frontend timer component UI (currently server-side only)
3. ❌ Student quiz results display
4. ❌ Professor quiz statistics/analytics

### Needs Implementation:
- Quiz shuffling/randomization
- Question shuffling
- Negative marking
- Custom scoring rules
- Export results to PDF

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Session - Login as Student:
```
Email: andrei.pop@roedu.ro
Password: Stud1234!

Visible Quizzes: Test Algebra (assigned to his group)
Expected: Should see 1 quiz
```

### Test Session - Login as Professor:
```
Email: ana.popescu@roedu.ro
Password: Prof1234!

Can Create: New quizzes
Can Manage: Student groups
Can View: All her quizzes
Cannot: Take quizzes, see other professor's content
```

### Test Timer Persistence:
```
1. Student starts quiz
2. Note the remaining time
3. Refresh page (F5)
4. Timer should continue from where it left off (not reset)
5. Close browser and reopen
6. Session restored, quiz still available to resume
```
